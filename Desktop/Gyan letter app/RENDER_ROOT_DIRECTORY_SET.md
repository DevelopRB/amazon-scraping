# ✅ Render Root Directory Configuration

## Your package.json Path:
`Desktop/Gyan letter app/package.json`

## Solution: Set Root Directory in Render

### Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard
1. Go to: **https://dashboard.render.com**
2. Click on your **Web Service** (backend service)

### Step 2: Open Settings
1. Click **"Settings"** tab (left sidebar)
2. Scroll down to **"Build & Deploy"** section

### Step 3: Set Root Directory
1. Find **"Root Directory"** field
2. **Enter exactly**: `Desktop/Gyan letter app`
   - Include the space in "Gyan letter app"
   - Use forward slashes `/` (not backslashes)
   - Do NOT include `package.json` in the path
3. Click **"Save Changes"** at the bottom

### Step 4: Verify Build Commands
While in Settings, verify:
- **Build Command**: `npm install`
- **Start Command**: `node server.js`

These should work correctly once Root Directory is set.

### Step 5: Redeploy
1. Go to **"Events"** or **"Logs"** tab
2. Click **"Manual Deploy"** → **"Deploy latest commit"**
3. Wait for deployment to complete

## Expected Result:
After setting Root Directory to `Desktop/Gyan letter app`, Render will:
- ✅ Find `package.json` at: `Desktop/Gyan letter app/package.json`
- ✅ Run `npm install` in that directory
- ✅ Run `node server.js` from that directory
- ✅ Build should succeed!

## If You Have Issues:

### Issue: Build still fails
- Double-check the Root Directory path matches exactly: `Desktop/Gyan letter app`
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or typos
- Verify the path on GitHub matches

### Issue: server.js not found
- Make sure `server.js` is also in `Desktop/Gyan letter app/` directory
- If it's in a different location, update Start Command accordingly

**Set Root Directory to: `Desktop/Gyan letter app` and redeploy!**
