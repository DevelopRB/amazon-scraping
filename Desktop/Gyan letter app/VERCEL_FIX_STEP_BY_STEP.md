# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX: Vercel Root Directory - STEP BY STEP

## The Problem
Error: `Could not read package.json: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/vercel/path0/package.json'`

This means **Vercel Root Directory is set incorrectly** in your project settings.

## ✅ SOLUTION (Do This Now)

### Step 1: Open Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Login if needed
3. Find and click on your project: **Gyan-Letter-App**

### Step 2: Open Settings
1. Click the **Settings** tab (top menu)
2. You should see several sections

### Step 3: Find "General" Section
1. Scroll down to find **"General"** section
2. Look for a field labeled **"Root Directory"**

### Step 4: Clear Root Directory
1. **Click on the "Root Directory" field**
2. **DELETE everything in it** (make it completely empty)
3. **Leave it BLANK**
4. Click **Save** (usually at the bottom of the page)

### Step 5: Verify Build Settings (Same Page)
While in Settings → General, check these:
- **Framework Preset**: Should be **"Other"** or **"Vite"**
- **Build Command**: Should be `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: Should be `dist`
- **Install Command**: Should be `npm install`

### Step 6: Clear Cache and Redeploy
1. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
2. Find the latest failed deployment
3. Click the **three dots (⋯)** on the right side
4. Click **"Redeploy"**
5. **IMPORTANT**: Check the box **"Use existing Build Cache"** = **UNCHECKED** (clear cache)
6. Click **"Redeploy"**

## What It Should Look Like

In Vercel Settings → General:

```
Root Directory: [THIS SHOULD BE EMPTY - NOTHING HERE]
```

**NOT:**
- ❌ `Desktop/Gyan letter app`
- ❌ `./`
- ❌ Any other path

## If You Don't See Root Directory Setting

If you can't find the Root Directory field:

1. Make sure you're in the **Settings** tab
2. Scroll all the way down in the General section
3. It might be under "Build & Development Settings"
4. If still not found, try:
   - Click on **"General"** to expand it
   - Look for any field related to "directory" or "path"

## Alternative: Delete and Re-import Project

If fixing Root Directory doesn't work:

### Delete Project:
1. Go to Settings
2. Scroll to bottom
3. Click **"Delete Project"**
4. Confirm deletion

### Re-import:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new
2. Click **"Import Git Repository"**
3. Select: **DevelopRB/Gyan-Letter-App**
4. **IMPORTANT**: When configuring:
   - **Root Directory**: Leave EMPTY (don't type anything)
   - Framework Preset: **Other**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
5. Click **"Deploy"**
6. Add environment variables (from VERCEL_ENV_VARIABLES.txt)

**After doing this, your build should work!**
