# 🚀 START HERE - Everything is Ready!

## ✅ What I've Done For You

1. ✅ Created all backend files (Express server, PostgreSQL routes, database setup)
2. ✅ Updated frontend to use PostgreSQL API
3. ✅ Added Excel upload with preview
4. ✅ Added delete confirmation modal
5. ✅ Created all configuration files
6. ✅ Created setup scripts and documentation

## 🎯 3 Simple Steps to Run

### Step 1: Create PostgreSQL Database

Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
psql -U postgres
```

Then in PostgreSQL, type:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE gyan_letter_db;
\q
```

**OR** use pgAdmin to create the database manually.

### Step 2: Update .env Password

The `.env` file has been created. **IMPORTANT**: Open it and change:

```
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
```

to your actual PostgreSQL password!

### Step 3: Start the App

**Easy Way (Windows):**
```powershell
.\start.ps1
```

**OR Manual (2 terminals):**

Terminal 1 - Backend:
```bash
npm run server
```

Terminal 2 - Frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```
