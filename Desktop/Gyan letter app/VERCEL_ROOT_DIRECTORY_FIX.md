# 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Vercel Root Directory Issue

## The Problem
Vercel error: `Could not read package.json: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory`

This means Vercel is looking in the wrong directory for your files.

## ✅ SOLUTION: Fix Root Directory in Vercel Dashboard

### Step-by-Step Fix:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Click on your project: **Gyan-Letter-App**

2. **Go to Settings**:
   - Click the **Settings** tab (top navigation)

3. **Find Root Directory**:
   - Scroll down to **General** section
   - Look for **"Root Directory"** field
   - **CURRENT VALUE**: It might be set to something like `Desktop/Gyan letter app` or another path
   - **CORRECT VALUE**: Should be **EMPTY** or `./`

4. **Fix It**:
   - **DELETE** whatever is in the Root Directory field
   - Leave it **COMPLETELY EMPTY** (blank)
   - Click **Save**

5. **Verify Build Settings** (while you're there):
   - Framework Preset: **Other** or **Vite**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

6. **Redeploy**:
   - Go to **Deployments** tab
   - Click the **three dots (⋯)** on the latest failed deployment
   - Click **Redeploy**

## Why This Happens

Vercel might have auto-detected a subdirectory or the Root Directory got set incorrectly. Since your `package.json` is in the repository root, the Root Directory must be empty.

## Visual Guide

In Vercel Settings → General, you should see:

```
Root Directory: [EMPTY - nothing here]
```

NOT:
```
Root Directory: Desktop/Gyan letter app
```

OR:
```
Root Directory: ./some/path
```

## After Fixing

Once you set Root Directory to empty and redeploy, Vercel will:
1. ✅ Find `package.json` in the root
2. ✅ Run `npm install` successfully
3. ✅ Run `npm run build` successfully
4. ✅ Deploy your app

**This is the most common cause of this error. Fix the Root Directory and redeploy!**
