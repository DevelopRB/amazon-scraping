# ✅ Root Directory Modal - What to Do

## What You See:
A modal with two options:
1. **"Gyan-Letter-App"** - Currently selected (with GitHub icon) ✅
2. **"Desktop"** - Unselected

## What to Do:

### Step 1: Select Repository Root
- **"Gyan-Letter-App"** is already selected ✅
- This is **CORRECT** - it represents your repository root
- **DO NOT** select "Desktop" or expand it

### Step 2: Click Continue
- Click the **"Continue"** button at the bottom right
- This will close the modal

### Step 3: Verify Root Directory is Empty
After clicking Continue, check the Root Directory field:
- **If it shows**: `"./"` or any path → **CLEAR IT** (make it empty)
- **If it's empty/blank**: ✅ Perfect! Leave it as is

### Step 4: If Root Directory Shows "./"
If after clicking Continue, the Root Directory field shows `"./"`:

1. Click **"Edit"** button next to Root Directory again
2. In the modal, make sure **"Gyan-Letter-App"** is selected
3. Click **"Continue"**
4. If it still shows `"./"`, manually:
   - Click in the Root Directory text field
   - Delete `"./"`
   - Leave it **completely empty**
   - The field should be blank

## Summary:
1. ✅ Select **"Gyan-Letter-App"** (already selected)
2. ✅ Click **"Continue"**
3. ✅ Verify Root Directory is **EMPTY** (not "./")
4. ✅ If not empty, manually clear it

**The goal is to have Root Directory completely EMPTY after this step!**
