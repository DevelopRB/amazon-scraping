# 🔧 Fix Render Root Directory Issue

## The Problem:
```
npm error path /opt/render/project/src/package.json
npm error enoent Could not read package.json
```

Render is looking for `package.json` in `/src/` but it's actually in the repository root.

## Solution: Fix Root Directory in Render

### Step 1: Go to Your Service Settings

1. Go to: **https://dashboard.render.com**
2. Click on your **Web Service** (backend service)
3. Click **"Settings"** tab (left sidebar)

### Step 2: Fix Root Directory

1. Scroll down to **"Build & Deploy"** section
2. Find **"Root Directory"** field
3. **CLEAR IT COMPLETELY** - leave it **EMPTY/BLANK**
4. **DO NOT** set it to `./` or `src/` or anything else
5. Click **"Save Changes"** at the bottom

### Step 3: Redeploy

1. Go to **"Events"** or **"Logs"** tab
2. Click **"Manual Deploy"** → **"Deploy latest commit"**
3. Wait for deployment to complete

## Alternative: If Root Directory Field Doesn't Exist

If you don't see a Root Directory field:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Build & Deploy**
2. Check **"Build Command"** - should be: `npm install`
3. Check **"Start Command"** - should be: `node server.js`
4. Make sure both are correct
5. Click **"Save Changes"**
6. Redeploy

## Verify Repository Structure

Make sure `package.json` is at the repository root:
- Go to: https://github.com/DevelopRB/Gyan-Letter-App
- Verify `package.json` is visible in the root (not in a subdirectory)

## If Still Not Working

### Option 1: Delete and Re-create Service

1. **Delete** the current Web Service
2. Create a **new Web Service**
3. When configuring:
   - **Root Directory**: Leave **EMPTY** (don't set anything)
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `node server.js`
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy

### Option 2: Check Build Settings

In Settings → Build & Deploy:
- **Build Command**: Should be `npm install` (not `cd src && npm install`)
- **Start Command**: Should be `node server.js` (not `cd src && node server.js`)

**The Root Directory MUST be empty for Render to find package.json in the repository root!**
