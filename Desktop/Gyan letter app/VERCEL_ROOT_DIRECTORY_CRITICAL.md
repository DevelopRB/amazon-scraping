# 🚨 CRITICAL: Root Directory MUST Be Empty

## The Error
```
npm error path /vercel/path0/package.json
npm error enoent Could not read package.json
```

This means **Root Directory is STILL set incorrectly** in Vercel Dashboard.

## ✅ FIX THIS NOW (Step by Step):

### Step 1: Open Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Click your project: **Gyan-Letter-App**

### Step 2: Go to Settings
1. Click **Settings** tab (top menu)
2. Scroll to **General** section

### Step 3: Find Root Directory Field
1. Look for **"Root Directory"** field
2. **IT IS PROBABLY SET TO SOMETHING LIKE:**
   - `Desktop/Gyan letter app`
   - `./`
   - `Gyan letter app`
   - Or some other path

### Step 4: CLEAR IT COMPLETELY
1. **Click on the Root Directory field**
2. **SELECT ALL TEXT** (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
3. **DELETE IT** (Backspace or Delete)
4. **LEAVE IT COMPLETELY EMPTY/BLANK**
5. **Click Save**

### Step 5: Verify It's Empty
After saving, check again:
- The field should show: `[empty]` or be completely blank
- **NOT** `./`
- **NOT** any path

### Step 6: Set Framework (While You're There)
In the same Settings → General section:
- **Framework Preset**: Select **"Vite"** from dropdown
- **Build Command**: Should auto-fill to `npm run build` (leave it)
- **Output Directory**: Should auto-fill to `dist` (leave it)
- **Install Command**: Should be `npm install` (leave it)

### Step 7: Save and Redeploy
1. Click **Save** at the bottom
2. Go to **Deployments** tab
3. Click **three dots (⋯)** on latest deployment
4. Click **Redeploy**
5. **UNCHECK** "Use existing Build Cache"
6. Click **Redeploy**

## Why This Keeps Happening

The Root Directory setting **does NOT change automatically** when you push code. It's a **manual setting in the Vercel dashboard** that you **MUST** clear yourself.

## Visual Guide

**❌ WRONG:**
```
Root Directory: Desktop/Gyan letter app
Root Directory: ./
Root Directory: Gyan letter app
```

**✅ CORRECT:**
```
Root Directory: [completely empty - nothing here]
```

**YOU MUST DO THIS IN THE DASHBOARD - IT CANNOT BE FIXED BY CODE CHANGES!**
