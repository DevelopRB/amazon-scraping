# 🔧 Root Directory Field Won't Delete - Solutions

## Problem:
The Root Directory field shows `"./"` but you can't delete it or it's read-only.

## Solutions (Try in Order):

### Solution 1: Use the Edit Button
1. Click the **"Edit"** button next to Root Directory
2. In the modal that opens, select **"Gyan-Letter-App"** (repository root)
3. Click **"Continue"**
4. The field should now be empty or you can edit it

### Solution 2: Leave It As "./" (It Might Work)
Actually, `"./"` means "current directory" which is the repository root. This **might work** if:
- Your `package.json` is at the repository root
- The build command is correct
- Framework is set to "Vite"

**Try deploying with `"./"` first** - it might actually work now that Framework is set to "Vite"!

### Solution 3: Skip This Step and Fix After Deployment
1. **Leave Root Directory as `"./"`** for now
2. Complete the rest of the configuration:
   - Framework: **Vite**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
3. Add Environment Variables
4. Click **"Deploy"**
5. **After deployment**, go to **Settings** → **General**
6. Try to edit Root Directory there (it might be editable after first deployment)

### Solution 4: Delete and Re-import Project
If nothing works:
1. **Cancel** this project creation
2. Go back to Vercel Dashboard
3. Delete the project (if it was created)
4. Start fresh import again
5. When the Root Directory modal appears, select **"Gyan-Letter-App"**
6. Click Continue
7. If it still shows `"./"`, proceed with deployment anyway

## Recommended Action:

**Try Solution 2 first** - Deploy with `"./"` and see if it works. Since:
- Framework is now set to "Vite" (auto-detection should work)
- Build commands are correct
- `"./"` means current directory (repository root)

The build might succeed even with `"./"` in the Root Directory field.

## After Deployment:

1. Check build logs
2. If build succeeds → Great! `"./"` worked
3. If build fails with package.json error → Use Solution 3 or 4

**Don't get stuck on this - try deploying with `"./"` first!**
