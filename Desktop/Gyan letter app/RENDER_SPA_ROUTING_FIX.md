# Fix SPA Routing on Render - Direct Links Not Working

## Problem
Direct links like `https://gyan-letter-app-1.onrender.com/database` show "Not Found" error.

## Solution: Configure Redirects in Render Dashboard

### Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard
1. Visit: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your static site service (e.g., `gyan-letter-app-1`)

### Step 2: Configure Redirects
1. Click on **"Settings"** tab
2. Scroll down to **"Redirects/Rewrites"** section
3. Click **"Add Redirect"** or **"Add Rewrite"**
4. Configure as follows:
   - **Source Path**: `/*`
   - **Destination Path**: `/index.html`
   - **Action**: **Rewrite** (NOT Redirect)
   - **Status Code**: `200` (if available)

### Step 3: Save and Redeploy
1. Click **"Save Changes"**
2. Render will automatically redeploy
3. Wait for deployment to complete (2-5 minutes)

### Step 4: Test
After deployment, test these URLs:
- `https://gyan-letter-app-1.onrender.com/database`
- `https://gyan-letter-app-1.onrender.com/editor`
- `https://gyan-letter-app-1.onrender.com/`

All should work correctly!

## Alternative: Using render.yaml (if supported)

If your Render service supports `render.yaml`, the file has been created with:
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: gyan-letter-app-frontend
    env: static
    buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
    staticPublishPath: ./dist
    routes:
      - type: rewrite
        source: /*
        destination: /index.html
```

## Why This Happens

React Router handles routing on the client-side. When you directly access `/database`, the server looks for a file at that path, which doesn't exist. By rewriting all routes to `/index.html`, React Router can then handle the routing correctly.

## Verification

After configuring redirects:
1. ✅ Direct links work: `/database`, `/editor`
2. ✅ Navigation works: Clicking links in the app
3. ✅ Refresh works: Refreshing any page shows correct content

**Note**: The `_redirects` file in `public/` folder is also included, but Render may require dashboard configuration for static sites.
